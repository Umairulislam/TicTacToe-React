# TIC TAC TOE

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built with React.The app uses React's built-in `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage the state of the game board and handle side effects such as updating the winner and displaying the moves in the game history.

## How to play

To play the game, simply click on any empty square to make a move. The first player is "X" and the second player is "O". The game ends when one player has three in a row or there are no more empty squares, resulting in a draw. You can also go back to any previous move and continue the game from there.
